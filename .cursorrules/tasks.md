## Notes and References

### 2023-11-20: Environment Variables Implementation
- Modified `emailserver/server.js` to use environment variables instead of hardcoded credentials
- Added dotenv package to the email server for environment variable loading
- Created documentation in `emailserver/README.md` with instructions on setting up the .env file
- The server now checks if email credentials are set and provides a warning if they're missing
