## Notes and References

### 2023-11-20: Environment Variables Implementation
- Modified `emailserver/server.js` to use environment variables instead of hardcoded credentials
- Added dotenv package to the email server for environment variable loading
- Created documentation in `emailserver/README.md` with instructions on setting up the .env file
- The server now checks if email credentials are set and provides a warning if they're missing

### 2023-11-20: Input Validation Implementation
- Added express-validator package for input validation
- Implemented validation for email format in the send-otp endpoint
- Added validation for OTP format and length in the verify-otp endpoint
- Created a reusable validation error handler middleware
- Updated API responses to return structured JSON with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Added a health check endpoint for monitoring
- Updated API documentation in README.md to reflect the new validation rules and response formats
